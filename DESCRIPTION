Title: Modified lmerTest carrots dataset
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Peter Kamerman
Maintainer: Peter Kamerman <Peter.kamerman@gmail.com>
Description: A reduced version of the carrots dataset which is distributed with the lmerTest package. The reduced dataset includes data from all 103 consumers included in the original dataset, but preference scores are only reported for 6 of the 12 Danish carrot types. The other columns retained from the original dataset are consumer rating of carrot sweetness, bitterness and crispiness; the frequency at which each consumer consumed carrots; and the age, sex, income, and employment categories the consumers fell into.
