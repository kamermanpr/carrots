# carrots

A reduced version of the carrots dataset which is distributed with the `lmerTest` package. The reduced dataset includes data from all 103 consumers included in the original dataset, but preference scores are only reported for 6 of the 12 Danish carrot types. The other columns retained from the original dataset are consumer rating of carrot sweetness, bitterness, and crispiness; the frequency at which each consumer consumed carrots; and the age, sex, income, and employment categories the consumers fell into.
